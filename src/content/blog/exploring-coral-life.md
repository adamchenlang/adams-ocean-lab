When I went snorkeling this summer, I saw tiny coral polyps moving their tentacles in the current. My dad told me they're animals, not plants ‚Äî which blew my mind! 

## The Discovery

I learned that each polyp builds a calcium skeleton, and together they form coral reefs that protect so many sea creatures. It was fascinating to watch them sway with the ocean currents, like a underwater dance.

## What Makes Coral Special

Coral polyps are actually related to jellyfish! They have:
- Tiny tentacles that catch food
- A hard skeleton made of calcium carbonate
- Symbiotic algae (zooxanthellae) that give them color
- The ability to reproduce both sexually and asexually

## My Dream Project

I want to build a mini reef in my tank someday and see how it grows. I've been researching:
- Water parameters needed for coral health
- Different types of beginner-friendly corals
- How to maintain the right lighting and flow
- The importance of patience (coral grows slowly!)

It's going to take time and careful planning, but I'm excited to create my own little ecosystem at home.
