At night, I turned off my tank lights slowly, and I noticed something â€” my clownfish stopped moving and hid inside their coral. I didn't know fish actually sleep!

## The Observation

I've been watching my fish tank for months, but I never really paid attention to what happens at night. When I dimmed the lights gradually (to avoid shocking them), I saw:
- My clownfish swimming to their favorite coral
- Their colors becoming slightly duller
- Their movements slowing down
- One of them lying on its side (which scared me at first!)

## Do Fish Really Sleep?

After some research, I learned that fish don't sleep like we do. They don't have eyelids, so their eyes stay open! But they do enter a rest state where:
- Their metabolism slows down
- They become less responsive to surroundings
- Some fish change color slightly
- They find safe hiding spots

## Different Sleep Patterns

Different fish sleep differently:
- **Clownfish**: Hide in anemones or coral
- **Parrotfish**: Make a mucus sleeping bag!
- **Some sharks**: Must keep swimming to breathe
- **Bettas**: Rest near the surface or on leaves

## My Experiment

I'm going to record their behavior over a week and see if they follow a schedule, just like humans do. I want to track:
- What time they go to "sleep"
- How long they rest
- Whether they wake up at the same time
- If the moon phase affects them (I have a lunar light)

## What I've Learned So Far

After 3 nights of observation:
- They usually settle down 30 minutes after lights dim
- They wake up gradually when lights come on
- They seem to prefer the same sleeping spots
- They're more active in the morning (feeding time!)

It's fascinating how even fish have routines. It makes me appreciate how all living things need rest, no matter how different we are.
