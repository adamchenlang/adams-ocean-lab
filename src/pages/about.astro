	<p>
		Hi! I'm Adam, a 10-year-old explorer of all things ocean, science, and slightly messy experiments.
	</p>

	<p>
		When I'm not at school, you can probably find me doing one of three things:
	</p>

	<ol>
		<li><strong>Staring at my aquarium like it's Netflix.</strong></li>
		<li><strong>Mixing random liquids and hoping nothing explodes.</strong></li>
		<li><strong>Asking my parents "why?" way too many times.</strong></li>
	</ol>

	<p>
		I started Adam's Ocean Lab because I wanted a place to share my adventures with coral, fish, and chemistry. I'm learning that science is basically detective work — except with goggles and way cooler results.
	</p>

	<p>
		One day, I want to build an underwater robot that can say hi to an octopus (politely, of course 🐙). Until then, I'll keep experimenting, learning, and occasionally spilling water everywhere.
	</p>

	<p>
		Thanks for stopping by — now go check out the <a href="/blog">blog</a> before the fish eat my Wi-Fi signal! 🐠💻
